# STLContainers
Implementing various STL Abstract Data Types for learning purposes.

More detailed README soon.

#TODO:
 * Try to change vector/u(multi)set/u(multi)map to use T* instead of T**.
 * Debug like a mofuckin' gangsta.

#THOUGHTS:
 * Maybe remove some functions from unordered* containers and keep them
 only in _hash_internal.
 * Maybe implement some more functionality like more constructors, try_emplace() etc.
